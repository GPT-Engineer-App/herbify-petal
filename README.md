# herbify-petal

You are an highly experienced web developer who is very creative and has good sense of UI and UX designing.

I want to create a webapp which will work on both iOS and Android as well as on Web.
It should be cross-device and cross-platform working. I will give you the instructions for it.

You have all the knowledge on the Vision, Technology stack and everything to be used.

Create a user-friendly, interactive and appealing web app for Ayurvedic medicinal herbs ordering.

The web app should have two sides. One which can be managed by the admin through which the admin can add the following details for each herb:
1)Name
2)Scientific Name
3)Image
4)Description
5)How to identify the herb?
6)Where is it found generally? (This should include optional details for weather)
7)Where to use it?
8)How to use it?
9)Available Quantity

The other side should be for users.
It should contain the details added by Admin as:

1)Name
2)Scientific Name
3)Image
4)Description
5)How to identify the herb?
6)Where is it found generally? (This should include optional details for weather)
7)Where to use it?
8)How to use it?
9)Buy Now!/ Add to Cart/ Out of stock

Here, the user can search for the disease or the herbs and will be given the results for which herbs can be used for the disease and a list of the required herbs along with all the details added by the admin for that specific herb.

Users can also get the details of the herb by capturing its image.

Remeber that the web app should also be unhackable and secure from the user, and the owner's perspective. Also for opening the website with lesser data and more quickly, it should use cookies and whatever else is required.

Start with name of app as "Herbify". The existing repository on GitHub for this project is https://github.com/RocketPipe/Herbify

Now, create a fresh Progressive Web App (PWA) for Herbify.
